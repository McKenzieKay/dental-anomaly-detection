In dentistry, AI-driven diagnoses are rare. This technological void can lead to dentist fatigue, resulting in lower quality of patient care. This code alleviates these issues with a multi-label classification model that automatically detects anomalies in dental panoramic X-rays, thus increasing the speed and accuracy of dentistsâ€™ diagnoses. The model is an ensemble of convolutional neural networks with various balancing techniques applied to the dataset, transfer learning from ResNet50, and uses class-weighted voting to determine the final predictions. The model achieved results of 60% precision, 57% percent recall, and 57% F1-score using the mean scores across the top performing classes.
